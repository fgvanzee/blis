Here are the steps to follow to create a new release (version) of BLIS:

1. Make sure there are no commits that have yet to be pulled into
   local repository.

   $ git pull

   If there are any commits upstream, merge them as appropriate.

2. Verify that the code builds properly.

   $ ./configure auto; make

3. Verify that the code passes BLIS and BLAS tests:

   $ make check     # short BLIS testsuite + BLAS test drivers
   $ make testblis  # full BLIS testsuite

4. Draft a new announcement to blis-devel, crediting those who
   contributed towards this version by browsing 'git log'.

5. Update CREDITS file if 'git log' reveals any new contributors.

6. Bump the version number:

   $ ./build/bump-version.sh "0.3.2"

7. Push the new commits and new tag associated with the new version:

   $ git push
   $ git push --tag

8. Send finalized announcement to blis-devel.

9. Update ReleaseNotes wiki with body of announcement.
